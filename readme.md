# Bible Text Inserter

This is a project to insert bible texts into a text.

It searches through the supplied text for bible references and replaces these references with the corresponding bible text, formatted.

It still needs a lot of work, though. This only works with the KJV and really needs to be optimised.

## Resources Used
